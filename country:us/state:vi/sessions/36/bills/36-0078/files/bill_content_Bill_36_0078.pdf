26 is determined that a reporting person has failed to file a financial interest statement or

4

2 1105, the Commission shall notify the person in writing. The notice must state in detail
3 the deficiency and the penalties for failure to file or for filing a deficient statement of

26 changes as necessary to protect the identity of the persons involved;

2 of a person upon a request with respect to the employee’s duties under this chapter. The
3 Commission shall provide the advice not later than 21 working days after the request, but
4 the time may be extended for good cause. It is a rebuttable presumption in any
5 enforcement proceeding initiated by the Commission and evidence of good faith conduct
6 in any other civil or criminal proceeding, if the requester at least 21 working days before
7 the alleged violation requested written advice from the Commission in good faith,
8 disclosed truthfully all material facts and committed the acts complained of either in
9 reliance on the advice or because of the failure of the Commission to provide advice

19 of this chapter may require the restitution plus interest of that gain to the appropriate
20 governmental body. The Attorney General or the Commission may apply to the Superior
21 Court of the Virgin Islands to seek enforcement of an order requiring such restitution.

1 Commission, in a timely manner, with any information necessary for the Commission to
2 perform its duties under this subsection.
3 (b) If a preliminary inquiry fails to establish reason to believe that this chapter has been
4 violated, the Commission may terminate the inquiry and notify the complainant and the person
5 who had been the subject of the inquiry. If the Commission determines that a complaint is
6 frivolous, it shall so state.
7 (c) If a preliminary inquiry establishes reason to believe this chapter has been violated,
8 the Commission shall initiate an investigation through its executive director to determine if
9 there has been a violation. The Commission shall keep information, records, and proceedings
10 relating to an investigation confidential until a final determination is made, except as otherwise
11 provided in subsection (g). Service of notice is complete upon mailing and must be by certified
12 or registered mail. The Commission shall notify the complainant not later than 60 days after
13 the commencement of an investigation, and thereafter, the Commission shall advise the
14 complainant and the person who is the subject of the investigation of the status of the
15 investigation at least every 90 days until the investigation is terminated. Not later than 180
16 days after the initiation of an investigation, the Commission shall either terminate the
17 investigation pursuant to subsection (d) or issue a findings report under subsection (e). Upon
18 a showing by the executive director of the need for an extension of this period, the Commission
19 may extend an investigation for up to two 90-day periods. A majority vote of members, a
20 quorum being present, must approve each 90-day extension. A findings report may not be
21 issued later than 360 days after initiation of an investigation. The Commission shall refer the
22 complaint to the Commission on Judicial Conduct promptly if the complaint concerns a judge
23 of a court established under title 4 of the Virgin Islands Code. On request of the Commission
24 of Judicial Conduct, the Commission shall provide any information or assistance that is not
25 prohibited by law. The Commission shall promptly refer the complaint to the Legislature’s

8
1 Standing Committee on Ethical Conduct or any successor committee having jurisdiction if the
2 complaint concerns a senator or employeeof the legislative branch.
3 (d) If an investigation indicates that no violation has been committed, the Commission
4 shall immediately terminate the investigation and send written notice of the determination to
5 the complainant and the person who was the subject of the investigation.
6 (e) The Commission, upon completing an investigation, shall issue a findings report to
7 the subject of an investigation setting forth the pertinent findings of fact by enumerating each
8 finding of fact by either number or letter. The subject may respond to the findings and request
9 an evidentiary hearing on the matter. The Commission shall grant any request for a hearing.
10 The hearing must be held in either the district of St. Croix or the district of St. Thomas and St.
11 John depending on the subject’s place of residence. Any response to a findings report must
12 either admit or deny the pertinent facts by the corresponding number and letter. The subject of
13 the investigation is entitled to have access to any evidence intended to be used by the
14 Commission at the hearing and any exculpatory evidence developed by the Commission during
15 its investigation.
16 (f) Matters not specifically denied in the response are deemed admitted. The response
17 must be filed no later than 30 business days from the date of issuance of the findings report
18 unless the Commission extends the time for good cause shown. Hearings conducted upon
19 request must be instituted not later than 45 days after the response.
20 (g) Not later than 90 days after the Commission receives the hearing record, or, if no
21 hearing is to be held, not later than 30 days after the Commission receives the response to the
22 findings report, the Commission shall issue a final order. Upon receipt of a final order, the
23 subject of the investigation may file a petition for reconsideration in accordance with the
24 regulations of the Commission.

26 requests an open hearing.
