2 (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Virgin Islands Water
3 and Power Authority (WAPA), the Virgin Islands Waste Management Authority
4 (VIWMA), or any other public utility agency may conduct emergency excavation on a

16 weekend or legal holiday, notification must be made no later than the next business day.
17 (3) All emergency work performed under this subsection remains subject to the
18 roadway restoration standards established in subsection (g), and DPW may inspect the

21 responsible agency from fines or penalties for failure to comply with restoration
22 standards, as provided in subsection (e).
23 (g) Roadway restoration standards
24 (1) Any individual, corporation, public utility, or other entity that excavates a
25 public roadway shall restore the roadway in accordance with standards prescribed by
4
1 DPW, including specifications for pavement thickness, materials, compaction, and
2 resurfacing techniques.
3 (2) Restoration must return the roadway to a condition equal to or better than its
4 condition prior to excavation.
5 (3) Where trenching or significant roadway disruption occurs, the responsible
6 party shall repave the entire affected lane or, if required by DPW, the entire width of the
7 roadway, to ensure safety, long-term durability, and uniformity.
8 (4) Temporary patching is not sufficient restoration.
9 (5) A party that fails to restore a roadway in compliance with this subsection shall
10 be subject to penalties and fines under subsection (e), and future permit privileges may
11 be suspended or revoked.
12 SECTION 2. (a) This act takes effect 90 days after its enactment.
