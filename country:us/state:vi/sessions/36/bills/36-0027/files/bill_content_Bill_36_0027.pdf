7 (3) “Disabled victim” means a person who becomes disabled or totally and
8 permanently disabled as a result of an accident caused by another person who has been
9 convicted of a violation of 20 V.I.C. § 493.
10 (c) The court shall order a defendant convicted of a violation of 20 V.I.C. § 504 who
11 was under the influence of or affected by intoxicating liquor or narcotic drugs; or convicted of
12 a violation of 20 V.I.C. § 493, which results in an accident that causes the victim to become
13 disabled or totally and permanently disabled; to pay child maintenance if the victim was the
14 parent or guardian of a minor child or dependent. The court shall order the defendant to pay
15 child maintenance until the child or dependent reaches:
16 (1) 18 years of age; or
17 (2) 19 years of age if the child or dependent is still enrolled in high school.

7 working days of receipt.
8 (f) If a defendant who has been ordered to pay child maintenance is incarcerated and
9 unable to pay, the defendant has not more than one year after the release from incarceration to
10 begin payments, including entering into a payment plan with the clerk of the court to pay any
11 arrearage.
12 (g) If a defendant’s child maintenance payments are set to terminate but the defendant’s
13 obligation is not paid in full, the child maintenance payments continue until the entire arrearage
14 is paid.
15 (h) (1) If the disabled victim or the surviving parent or guardian of the child or
16 dependent brings a civil action against the defendant before the court enters an order for child
17 maintenance and the disabled victim or the surviving parent or guardian obtains a judgment
18 and full satisfaction of damages in the civil suit, the court may not enter a child maintenance
19 order.
20 (2) If the court orders the defendant to pay child maintenance and the disabled victim
