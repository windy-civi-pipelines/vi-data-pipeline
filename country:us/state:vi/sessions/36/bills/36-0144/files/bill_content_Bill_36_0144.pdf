BILL NO. 36-0144
Thirty-Sixth Legislature of the Virgin Islands
August 26, 2025
An act amending title 14 Virgin Islands Code, chapter 113 to define and prohibit assault rifles,
ban suppressors and silencers, require safety training for licensed rifles and shotgun holders;
prohibit large-capacity magazines and prevent the illegal sales of firearms, firearm accessories
and ammunition
PROPOSED BY: Senators Clifford A. Joseph, Sr. and Marise C. James
1 WHEREAS, the Legislature of the Virgin Islands finds that public safety in the Territory
2 is threatened due to the proliferation of firearms designed for military or tactical use that are
3 capable of delivering rifle-caliber firepower from concealable platforms;
4 WHEREAS, firearms such as the Sig Sauer MCX pistol, the Daniel Defense DDM4
5 PDW, CCMG Dissent MK4, Smith & Wesson M&P 15 and similarly configured weapons pose
6 a distinct threat to law enforcement and the public, particularly due to their concealability,
7 armor-piercing potential, and compatibility with suppressors, rifle scopes, and military-grade
8 accessories; and

2
1 WHEREAS, these weapons serve no legitimate civilian purpose for self-defense or sport
2 and are commonly used in criminal activity. Accordingly, their possession and use present an
3 unacceptable risk to public safety and must be prohibited; Now, therefore
