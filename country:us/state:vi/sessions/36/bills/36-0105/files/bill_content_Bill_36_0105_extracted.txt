BILL NO. 36-0105
Thirty-Sixth Legislature of the Virgin Islands
June 24, 2025
An act amending title 7 Virgin Islands Code, chapter 13, subchapter III to prohibit the
possession, sale, or manufacture of tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, delta-6 THC, delta-8 THC and
delta-10 THC products in the Virgin Islands and for other related purposes
PROPOSED BY: Senators Clifford A. Joseph, Sr., and Marise C. James
Co-sponsor: Hubert L. Frederick
1 WHEREAS, the federal Hemp Farming Act of 2018 legalized hemp-derived products
2 containing less than 0.3% delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (“delta-9 THC”);
3 WHEREAS, Act No. 8680 expanded the legalization of cannabis from medicinal use to
4 adult use cannabis in the Virgin Islands;
5 WHEREAS, clarifying the definition of hemp will ensure equitable regulation,
6 enforcement, and reduce ambiguity for businesses, law enforcement, and regulators, while
7 keeping the Virgin Islands competitive in the hemp industry and spur economic development;
8 WHEREAS, delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (“delta-8 THC”) products have not been
9 evaluated or approved by the Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”); as such, there is no
10 guarantee of accuracy in labeling, potentially exposing consumers to risks;
2
1 WHEREAS, delta-8 THC is naturally found in very small amounts in cannabis, and to
2 produce the concentrations needed for commercial products, it is typically synthesized from
3 hemp-derived cannabidiol using chemical processes;
4 WHEREAS, the chemical process may involve unsafe chemicals and may result in
5 harmful byproducts or contaminants in the final product, if not properly managed;
6 WHEREAS, delta-8 THC can be habit-forming or cause dependence, which can lead to
7 addiction;
8 WHEREAS, many delta-8 THC products are marketed in ways to be appealing to
9 children, mimicking candy and snack foods, thereby increasing the risk of accidental overdose
10 and ingestion by children;
11 WHEREAS, product labels may be unclear or misleading, causing consumers to
12 underestimate the psychoactive effects of delta-8 THC products;
13 WHEREAS, the FDA has received reports of adverse events related to delta-8 THC
14 consumption, including hallucinations, vomiting, tremors, anxiety, dizziness, confusion, and
15 loss of consciousness;
16 WHEREAS, poison control centers have also received numerous calls concerning delta-
17 8-THC exposures, with a significant number involving unintentional exposure by children;
18 WHEREAS, states and territories have the authority to introduce laws regulating or
19 banning delta-8 THC and other cannabinoids; and
20 WHEREAS, more than a dozen states have moved to control or ban delta-8 THC and
21 similar products; Now, Therefore,
22 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the Virgin Islands:
