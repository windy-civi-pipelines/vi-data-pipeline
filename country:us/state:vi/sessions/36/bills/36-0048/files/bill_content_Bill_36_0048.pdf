PROPOSED BY: Senator Novelle E. Francis, Jr.

2 SECTION 1. Title 22 Virgin Islands Code, chapter 3 is amended by adding the
3 following section 53b:
4 “§53b. Annual rate change for medical malpractice liability insurance
5 (a) The Commissioner shall prescribe, by regulation, a designated range of
6 annual rate change for medical malpractice liability insurance, which must be an increase
7 or decrease of between not less than 5% and not more than 15%, and within which any
8 rate, supplementary rate information, or change or amendment thereof, filed by an
9 insurer or rating organization, becomes effective not less than 30 days after the f iling.
10 (1) The Commissioner may determine, pursuant to regulation, the
11 categories, subcategories, specialties, and subspecialties of the health care
12 provider to which the application of the designated range will apply.
13 (2) Only one filing by an insurer or rating organization of a proposed

2
1 rate change within the designated range may take effect within any 12-month
2 period without the express approval of the Commissioner, as set forth in
3 subsection (c).
4 (b) In prescribing the designated range of annual rate change, the
5 Commissioner may consider the availability and affordability of medical malpractice
6 liability insurance for different categories, subcategories, specialties, and
7 subspecialties of the health care provider in relation to the capitalization and reserve
8 requirements necessary to ensure the solvency of the insurers. The Commissioner may
9 also consider current data relating to the frequency and severity of medical malpractice
10 claims and trends in the cost of investigating, defending and settling claims.
11 (c) (1) Any filing by an insurer or rating organization proposing a rate change
12 that exceeds t he designated range established pursuant to subsection (a) or proposing
13 an additional rate change within this range during any 12-month period, is subject to
14 approval by the Commissioner.
15 (2) If the Commissioner determines that there is not sufficient evidence to justify
16 a new rate, the Commissioner may disallow the rate increase. The reason for the rejection
17 must be in writing. An aggrieved carrier may demand a hearing pursuant to chapter 7 of
18 this title to reconsider the ruling and may appeal from the Commissioner's order refusing
19 a hearing or an order on hearing to the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands. The appeal
20 must be taken within 30 days.

14 (A) certify the inflation-adjusted limit calculated under this
15 subsection; and
16 (B) inform the Commissioner of Health and the Superior Court
17 of the Virgin Islands of the certified limit.
18 (h) The term “inflation” as used in subsection (g) means the seasonally

23 (2) in subsection (e)(3), strike “$250,000” and insert “$400,000”; and

10
1 “(j) The liability amounts in subsection (b) and subsection (e)(3) must be
2 adjusted to conform with the provisions of 27 V.I.C. §166b(g).”
3 (d) In section 166i:
4 (1) in subsection (b), insert “if the complaint is accompanied by an Affidavit of
5 Merit consistent with section 166n” after “provider in court”.
6 (2) in subsection (d), add paragraph (5) to read:
7 “(5) In an action subsequently brought by a claimant in court after a finding
8 by the expert under subsection (d)(1) that the health care provider acted within the
9 appropriate standards of medical care as charged in the proposed complaint, the
10 claimant shall file an Affidavit of Merit, consistent with section 166n, and post a
11 bond, consistent with section 166o, with the filing of the complaint.”
12 (e) add sections 166n through 166q to read:
13 “§166n. Affidavit of Merit
14 (a) Except as provided in subsection (f), the claimant shall file the Affidavit of Merit
15 required to be filed under section 166i subsections (b) and (d)(5) as to each named defendant
16 signed by an expert witness, as defined in section 166p(b)(1), and accompanied by a current
17 curriculum vitae of the expert witness, stating that:
18 (1) the expert is competent under section 166p (b) to express an opinion or
19 opinions in the case; and
20 (2) there are reasonable grounds and a good faith basis to maintain an action
21 consistent with the requirements of section166p(a) as to each named defendant.
22 (b) The Affidavit of Merit and curriculum vitae must be filed with the court in a
23 sealed envelope which must state on its face:

11
1 "CONFIDENTIAL SUBJECT TO 27 V.I.C. §166n. THE CONTENTS OF
2 THIS ENVELOPE MAY ONLY BE VIEWED BY A JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR
3 COURT."
4 (c) Notwithstanding 3 V.I.C. §881 or any law to the contrary, the Affidavit of Merit
5 must be and must remain sealed and confidential, except as provided in subsection (g).
6 (d) If the Affidavit of Merit is not filed with the complaint, the court shall dismiss
7 as provided in subsection (e) absent a showing that the failure was due to demonstrated
8 extraordinary cause.
9 (e) The failure of a claimant to file an Affidavit of Merit in compliance with this
10 section, upon motion, makes the action subject to dismissal with prejudice. The court
11 may, upon timely motion of the claimant and for extraordinary cause shown, grant a single
12 60-day extension to file the Affidavit of Merit. Extraordinary cause includes the inability
13 to obtain, despite reasonable efforts, relevant medical records for expert review. A motion
14 to extend the time for filing an Affidavit of Merit is timely only if it is filed on or before
15 the filing date of the complaint. The filing of a motion to extend the time for filing an
16 Affidavit of Merit tolls the time period within which the affidavit must be filed until the
17 court rules on the motion. In cases where a motion to extend the time for filing an Affidavit
18 of Merit is filed, the defendant is not required to take any action with respect to the
19 complaint until 20 days after the court rules on the motion and the claimant has filed the
20 Affidavit of Merit.
21 (f) An Affidavit of Merit is not required if the complaint alleges a rebuttable
22 inference of medical negligence, the grounds of which are set forth in subsection (h).
23 (g) Upon motion by the defendant, the court shall determine in camera if the
24 Affidavit of Merit complies with subsection (a). The Affidavit of Merit is not discoverable
25 in any malpractice action. The Affidavit of Merit itself, and the fact that an expert has

12
1 signed the Affidavit of Merit, are not discoverable or admissible, nor may the expert be
2 questioned in any respect about the existence of the Affidavit of Merit in the underlying
3 malpractice action or any subsequent unrelated malpractice action in which that expert serves
4 as a witness.
5 (h) (1) A rebuttable inference that personal injury or death was caused by medical
6 negligence arises where evidence is presented that the personal injury or death occurred in any
7 one or more of the following circumstances:
8 (A) A foreign object was unintentionally left within the body of the
9 patient following surgery;
10 (B) An explosion or fire originating in a substance used in treatment
11 occurred in the course of treatment; or
12 (C) A surgical procedure was performed on the wrong patient or the wrong
13 organ, limb or part of the patient's body.
14 (2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (1), there may be no inference or
15 presumption of negligence on the part of a health care provider.
16 §166o. Requirement of a Bond
17 (a) The bond required to be filed under section 166i(d)(5) must be in the amount
18 $6,000.00 in the aggregate, secured by cash or its equivalent, and filed with the clerk of the
19 Superior Court of the Virgin Islands, payable to the defendant in the case for costs assessed,
20 including witness and experts fees and attorney's fees if the claimant does not prevail in the
21 final judgment. If the bond is not posted when the complaint is filed, the action shall be
22 dismissed.
23 (b) Upon motion filed by the claimant, and a determination by the court that the
24 claimant is indigent, the judge may reduce the amount of the bond but may not eliminate the
25 requirement of a bond.

13
1 §166p. Claimant’s burden in medical malpractice action, expert testimony, jury
2 instructions
3 (a) In a malpractice action, the claimant has the burden of proving by expert testimony,
4 the qualifications of which are described in subsection (b), the following:
5 (1) The recognized standard of acceptable professional practice in the profession
6 and the specialty thereof, if any, that the defendant practices in the community in which
7 the defendant practices or in a similar community at the time the alleged injury or
8 wrongful action occurred;
9 (2) That the defendant acted with less than or failed to act with ordinary and
10 reasonable care in accordance with the standard in paragraph (1); and
11 (3) As a proximate result of the defendant's negligent act or omission, the
12 claimant suffered injuries which would not otherwise have occurred.
13 (b) (1) No person in a health care profession requiring licensure under the laws of this
14 Territory is competent to testify in any court of law to establish the facts required to be
15 established by subsection (a), unless the person was licensed to practice in any U.S. state or
16 territory, a profession or specialty which would make the person's expert testimony relevant to
17 the issues in the case, and has practiced this profession or specialty and has been engaged in
18 the treatment of patients in a relevant field of medicine to the issues in the case in a U.S. state
19 or territory during the year immediately preceding the date that the alleged injury or wrongful
20 act occurred.
21 (2) The requirements of paragraph (1) also apply to expert witnesses testifying
22 for the defendant as rebuttal witnesses.
23 (c) (1) In a malpractice action, the court shall instruct the jury that the claimant has the
24 burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, the negligence of the defendant and,
25 that as a proximate result of the defendant's negligent act or omission, the claimant suffered an

14
1 injury or injuries which would not otherwise have occurred. The court shall further instruct the
2 jury that injury alone does not raise a presumption of a defendant's negligence.
3 (2) The instructions required to be given in paragraph (1) must also be applied
4 in the case of a bench trial.
5 §166q. Claimant’s burden in action for failure to obtain informed consent
6 In a malpractice action based upon the lack of informed consent, the claimant shall prove
7 by expert testimony, the qualifications of which are described in section 166p (b), that the
8 defendant did not supply appropriate information to the claimant in obtaining informed consent
9 as to the procedure out of which claimant's claim allegedly arose, in accordance with the
10 recognized standards of acceptable professional practice in the profession and in the specialty,
11 if any, that the defendant practices in the community in which the defendant practices and in
12 similar communities.”
13 BILL SUMMARY

2 Medical Malpractice Action Review Committee (“Committee”) fails to receive an expert
3 opinion within 90 days from the filing date of the complaint and requiring a patient to file an
4 Affidavit of Merit and a bond in the amount of $6,000 in cases where the expert selected by
5 the Committee renders an opinion that a health care provider acted within the appropriate
6 standards of medical care and the patient proceeds to file a malpractice suit in court;
7 establishing the requirements for an Affidavit of Merit and requiring the affidavit to be signed
8 by an expert witness and accompanied by a current curriculum vitae of the expert witness;
9 allowing a judge to reduce the amount of the $6,000 bond upon filing of a motion by the
10 claimant and a determination by the court that the claimant is indigent; establishing the factors
11 to be proven to establish a rebuttable inference that personal injury or death was caused by
12 medical negligence and providing that an Affidavit of Merit is not required in cases where this
13 inference exists; and establishing a claimant’s burden in a malpractice action and the jury
14 instructions to be given by the court in a jury or bench trial.
