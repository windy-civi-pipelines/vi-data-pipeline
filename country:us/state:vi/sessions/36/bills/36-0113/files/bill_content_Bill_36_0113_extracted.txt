15 encourage all servers of alcohol to exercise responsible serving practices and to discourage the
16 irresponsible consumption of alcohol, to increase the availability and usage of liquor liability
17 insurance, and to reinforce the public safety message, ‘do not drink and drive’;
18 WHEREAS, this act would also protect businesses by eliminating liability by the
19 intoxicated first-party and limiting liability to a small class of innocent persons who are injured
20 in motor vehicle accidents; Now, Therefore,
21 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the Virgin Islands:
22 SECTION 1. Title 8 Virgin Islands Code, chapter 4 is amended by striking section 161

2 who has suffered injury, death or other damage caused by an intoxicated person against
3 any person who sold or otherwise furnished alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person,

5 (2) Innocent Persons. A person who has suffered injury, death or any other
6 damage due to a motor vehicle accident caused by an intoxicated person, may bring a
7 claim or cause of action against any person who sold or otherwise furnished alcoholic
8 beverages to the intoxicated person if:
9 (a) The intoxicated person was younger than the legal age for the
10 consumption of alcoholic beverages at the time the alcoholic beverages were sold
11 or furnished and the person who sold or furnished the alcoholic beverages knew or
12 should have known at the time the alcoholic beverages were sold or furnished that
13 the intoxicated person was younger than the legal age for consumption of the
14 alcoholic beverages; or
15 (b) The intoxicated person was visibly intoxicated at the time the alcoholic
16 beverages were sold or furnished, and the person who sold or furnished the
17 alcoholic beverages knew or should have known under a reasonably prudent person
18 standard that the intoxicated person was visibly intoxicated and foreseeably
19 presented a danger to himself or others.
20 (c) This section is inapplicable to a person who is not operating a motor
21 vehicle.
22 (3) Intoxicated Persons and Passengers.
23 (a) No claim or cause of action may be brought by the intoxicated person
24 or on behalf of the intoxicated person’s estate or representatives under this section.

26 passenger in an motor vehicle driven by an intoxicated person or on behalf of the

1 passenger’s estate or representatives under this section, unless the passenger was
2 under the age of 21 years old.
3 BILL SUMMARY
4 This bill limits a legal claim to only innocent persons who are struck by a drunk driver in
5 a car accident. The innocent person must prove that the person driving was intoxicated and
6 that prior to the car accident a server continued to over-serve alcohol to the obviously
7 intoxicated person. The current law requires showing service to a person “habitually addicted”
8 which is an archaic standard of proof. The drunk driver and any passengers in the drunk
9 driver’s car have no legal right to bring an action against the server (unless the passenger is
10 under that age of 21 and thus may not have had the ability to refuse riding in the vehicle or was
11 unable to understand the driver was intoxicated
