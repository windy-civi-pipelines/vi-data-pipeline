PROPOSED BY: Senator Milton E. Potter, by Request of the Governor
1 WHEREAS, the cost of fully funded group health insurance coverage for government
2 employees and retirees has drastically increased in recent years, placing a substantial burden on

4 WHEREAS, self-funded insurance plans are increasingly utilized by public sector
5 employers as a means to achieve long-term cost control, risk management and improved plan
6 flexibility;
7 WHEREAS, a self-funded model allows the Government to pay actual claims as they are
8 incurred, rather than fixed monthly premiums, potentially resulting in substantial fiscal savings;
9 WHEREAS, the Government Employee Service Commission is the entity charged with
10 overseeing the administration and procurement of health benefits for government personnel and
11 retirees and it has failed to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to consider and compare a self-
