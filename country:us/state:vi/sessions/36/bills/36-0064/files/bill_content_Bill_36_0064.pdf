BILL NO. 36-0064
Thirty-Sixth Legislature of the Virgin Islands
March 28, 2025
An act amending title 33 Virgin Islands Code, chapter 111, section 3100i to align the
disbursement and spending limitations of funds allotted to public schools from the Education
Initiative Fund with the realities of academic planning, ensuring that funds are used to
maximize student success
PROPOSED BY: Senators Kurt A. Vialet and Angel L. Bolques, Jr.
Co-sponsors: Clifford A. Joseph, Sr., Novelle E. Francis, Jr.
Milton E. Potter and Ray Fonseca
1 WHEREAS, school funds are allocated for schools in October to be expended by
2 September, creating a restrictive spending window;
3 WHEREAS, these funds are not distributed to schools until March, significantly
4 reducing the time available for effective planning and utilization of resources;
5 WHEREAS, the summer break beginning in June further shortens the timeframe, leaving
6 administrators with only a brief period to plan and utilize funds before the September deadline;
7 WHEREAS, when schools resume in August, administrators are left with just one month
8 to spend remaining funds, often leading to rushed or inefficient expenditures that do not align
9 with long-term educational priorities;
10 WHEREAS, the current funding timeline limits schools' ability to make strategic
11 investments in staffing, infrastructure, instructional materials, and student programs;

2
1 WHEREAS, any funds unexpended by the September deadline are returned to the
2 Education Initiative Fund, reducing the total amount available for direct educational use;
3 WHEREAS, the requirement to return unspent funds results in schools expending less
4 than their full allotment, thereby hindering their ability to implement critical programs,
5 purchase necessary resources, and enhance student achievement;
6 WHEREAS, the failure to fully expend allocated funds may create a misleading
7 perception that schools require less funding than is actually needed, potentially leading to
8 reduced future appropriations and negatively impacting long-term educational planning;
9 WHEREAS, amending the law to make funds "available until expended" would provide
10 schools with the necessary flexibility needed to allocate resources effectively ensuring that
11 financial decisions are based on educational priorities rather than arbitrary spending deadlines;
12 and
13 WHEREAS, allowing funds to carry over beyond the fiscal year would minimize
14 wasteful spending, improve financial and academic planning, and ensure that resources are
15 fully utilized to maximize student success; Now, Therefore,
16 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the Virgin Islands:
17 SECTION 1. Title 33 Virgin Islands Code, chapter 111, section 3100i is repealed.
