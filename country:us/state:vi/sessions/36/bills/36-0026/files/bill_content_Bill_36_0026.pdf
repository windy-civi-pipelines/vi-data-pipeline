5 § 1088. Meteorological Office purpose and establishment
6 (a) The purpose of this subchapter is to establish the Virgin Islands Meteorological
7 Office to monitor weather conditions, provide accurate forecasts, establish a Doppler Weather
8 Radar Station in St. Croix, and enhance preparedness and response to weather-related hazards
9 in the Territory.
10 (b) There is established the Virgin Islands Meteorological Office, ("Meteorological
11 Office" or “Office”) that operates within the Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency Management

2
1 Agency (“VITEMA”) and is responsible for accurate weather data collection and reporting,
2 monitoring and forecasting weather conditions, and reporting on climate patterns and
3 atmospheric phenomena.
4 (c) The Meteorological Office is headed by a Meteorologist hired by the Director of
5 VITEMA. The meteorologist may hire a meteorologist assistant, executive assistant, and other
6 support staff that are necessary to carry out the duties and responsibilities of the Office. The
7 Director of VITEMA is responsible for overseeing the operations of the Meteorological Office

9 § 1088a. Definitions
10 As used throughout this subchapter:
11 (1) “Agency” means the Virgin Islands Territorial Emergency Management Agency.
12 (2) “Atmospheric Scientist” means a person who studies the climate, weather, and
13 atmospheric conditions in the past and present, and a more likely to study ancient data.
14 Atmospheric sciences are traditionally divided into three topical areas, meteorology,
15 climatology and aeronomy.
16 (3) “Meteorologist” means a scientist who studies the atmosphere and its phenomena,
17 including weather and climate, and who investigates long-term climate trends and the impact
18 on human populations.
19 (4) “Meteorological Assistant” means a professional who supports a meteorologist
20 or atmospheric scientist in various tasks related to the study and analysis of weather and climate
21 patterns and whose responsibilities may include collecting and analyzing weather data,
22 operating meteorological instruments, assisting with research projects, preparing weather
23 forecasts or reports, and maintaining meteorological databases.

3
1 (5) “Executive Assistant” means a support staff who provides high-level
2 administrative support to senior personnel, managing schedules, correspondence, meetings,
3 and special projects, ensuring smooth office operations, and enhancing management
4 productivity.

7 the following duties and responsibilities:
8 (1) monitor weather conditions and collect data from various sources, including
9 weather stations, satellites, radar systems, and buoys;
10 (2) measure parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, air pressure,
11 precipitation, and cloud cover; monitor factors like sea surface temperatures and greenhouse
12 gas concentrations; use advanced numerical weather models to simulate atmospheric processes
13 and predict weather conditions;
14 (3) maintain and operate weather observation stations, radar systems, satellite
15 receivers, and other necessary equipment to support meteorological operations;
16 (4) conduct research and analysis to improve understanding of local weather patterns,
17 enhance forecasting capabilities and inform policies related to climate change mitigation and
18 adaptation;
19 (5) collaborate with national meteorological agencies, research institutions, and other
