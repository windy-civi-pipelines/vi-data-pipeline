COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE
DEVELOPMENT
10/22/2025-HELD IN COMMITTEE
Thirty-Sixth Legislature of the Virgin Islands
March 28, 2025
An Act amending title 17 Virgin Islands Code, chapter 9, subchapter 1, section 82, subsection
(a) by changing the age a child begins kindergarten from five years of age to four years of age
PROPOSED BY: Senator Alma Francis Heyliger
1 WHEREAS, children at the age of four demonstrate significant cognitive development,
2 marked by improved language skills, problem-solving abilities, and curiosity, and starting
3 school at this age can harness their enthusiasm for learning, providing a foundation for
4 academic success;
5 WHEREAS, educational institutions play a crucial role in identifying and addressing
6 developmental delays or learning difficulties and, therefore, starting school at age four allows
7 for timely intervention and tailored support, maximizing the potential for overcoming
8 challenges before they become more pronounced;
9 WHEREAS, school serves as a platform for developing essential socialization skills,
10 such as cooperation, communication, and conflict resolution; therefore, commencing education
11 at age four encourages the early cultivation of these skills, setting the stage for healthier
12 interpersonal relationships throughout life;
2
1 WHEREAS, research suggests that children vary widely in their developmental
2 readiness for school, with some children showing readiness for structured learning
3 environments at age four, indicating that they are equipped to benefit from the educational
4 experience and thrive academically;
5 WHEREAS, initiating formal education at age four can contribute to bridging learning
6 disparities among children from different socio-economic backgrounds, and early exposure to
7 educational resources and experiences can help mitigate the gap in academic achievement that
8 often emerges before age five;
9 WHEREAS, an early start to education can foster a positive attitude towards learning
10 from an early age, and engaging children in educational activities at age four can establish a
11 lifelong love for learning and increase the likelihood of higher educational attainment;
12 WHEREAS, starting school at age four can promote increased parental involvement in
13 their child's education, and parents are more likely to be engaged in their child's early education,
14 participating in school activities, and reinforcing learning at home;
15 WHEREAS, the transition from early childhood settings to formal schooling can be
16 smoother at age four, as children are generally more adaptable and resilient during this phase,
17 and this adjustment period is crucial for building confidence and a positive attitude towards
18 schooling;
19 WHEREAS, a comprehensive education encompasses not only academic learning but
20 also physical, emotional, and creative development, and initiating school at age four provides
21 more time to integrate these aspects into the curriculum, fostering well-rounded individuals;
22 WHEREAS, many countries have adopted a lower starting age for formal education with
23 positive outcomes, and by aligning with international practices, starting school at age four can
24 help prepare Virgin Islands children for the challenges of an increasingly interconnected world;
3
1 WHEREAS, setting the standard age for a child to begin school at age four rather than
2 age five is supported by a range of factors, including cognitive development, socialization,
3 readiness indicators, and long-term educational engagement; and
4 WHEREAS, this approach promotes early intervention, reduces learning disparities, and
5 contributes to a more holistic and adaptable educational experience for children; Now,
6 Therefore,
7 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the Virgin Islands:
8 SECTION 1. Title 17 Virgin Islands Code, chapter 9, subchapter 1, section 82,
9 subsection (a) is amended by striking “fifth” and inserting “fourth”.
10 BILL SUMMARY
11 This bill changes the age a child entering kindergarten from five years of age to four.
