BILL NO. 36-0006
Thirty-Sixth Legislature of the Virgin Islands
February 27, 2025
An Act appropriating $600,000 to the Department of Agriculture to be used to fund farmers in
the Virgin Islands that produce crops and other food products; and for other related purposes
PROPOSED BY: Senator Angel L. Bolques, Jr.
1 WHEREAS, the Virgin Islands needs to establish a sustainable food system that
2 addresses production, transportation, transformation, market sales, consumption, waste, and
3 composting;
4 WHEREAS, farmers in the Virgin Islands find it extremely difficult to maintain their
5 farms with a limited number of staff and a lack of large farming equipment, such as tractors
6 and plows;
7 WHEREAS, the Department of Agriculture does not have the resources to fulfill the vast
8 number of requests to clear and plow land due to its limited amount of personnel and heavy
9 machinery;
10 WHEREAS, many farmers suffer from a lack of water and insufficient irrigation systems
11 and rely on the Department of Agriculture to provide water for their farms;

2
1 WHEREAS, farms in the Virgin Islands have not adopted efficient, new farming
2 technology because of their inability to afford it and therefore cannot compete with other
3 Caribbean agricultural industries;
4 WHEREAS, St. Croix was once a leader in agriculture due to its climate, soil, and
5 potential access to water;
6 WHEREAS, the agriculture industry in St. Croix lost its capital due to the rise in the oil
7 refining industry and has since been unable to maintain a competitive level of farming that
8 would provide food sustainability, especially in the event of a disaster;
9 WHEREAS, food imported into the Virgin Islands in 2019 cost $128,440,660;
10 WHEREAS, the people of the Virgin Islands are suffering because the price of food has
11 increased due to the lack of investment in the agricultural industry and the need for retailers to
12 import food rather than export it;
13 WHEREAS, the Virgin Islands currently does not have the means to create a sustainable
14 and independent food system due to the lack of investment in the agricultural industry and the
15 inability for large, potentially high-production farms to afford to produce large crops year-
16 round; Now, Therefore,
17 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the Virgin Islands:
18 SECTION 1. (a) The sum of $600,000 is appropriated in the fiscal year ending
