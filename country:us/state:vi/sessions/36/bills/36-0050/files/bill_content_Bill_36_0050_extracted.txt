17 §539. Grounds for disciplinary proceedings
18 (a) The Board may deny an application or, after a hearing, refuse to renew, suspend,
19 revoke, censure, reprimand, restrict, or limit a license issued on proof that the person has
20 engaged in unprofessional conduct within the five years preceding the filing of the complaint
21 or the initiation of disciplinary action, including:
22 (1) conviction of a felony;
23 (2) conviction of a misdemeanor under this chapter;
24 (3) conviction of fraud or deceit in connection with the practice of social work
25 as defined in this chapter or in establishing qualifications under this chapter;

1 (4) aiding or abetting a person not licensed under this chapter who is falsely

3 (5) failing to be relicensed and continuing to represent themselves as licensed
4 after the expiration of their license;

12 the Board of not less than $100 but not more than $1,000, for each violation. Each violation
13 of this chapter or regulations of the Board pertaining to unlawfully engaging in the practice of
14 social work constitutes a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than $100, but not more
15 than $1,000.
16 § 540. Disciplinary proceedings
17 (a) The Board shall conduct all hearings, which must be recorded by stenograph.
18 Board decisions must be made by majority vote. The Board shall give not less than 20 days

20 (b) The respondent has the right to:
21 (1) representation, either by counselor otherwise;
22 (2) cross-examination of witnesses;
23 (3) to call witnesses on the respondent’s behalf; and
24 (4) to subpoena witnesses and documents.

1 (c) Judicial review of the refusal to allow an examination, to grant a license, or the

4 § 541. Renewal of licenses
5 (a) All licenses are effective when issued by the Board.
6 (b) A license issued under this chapter is valid for two years from the date of
7 issuance and expires on the last day of the month of February.
8 (c) A license may be renewed by the payment of the renewal fee and by the completion
9 and submission—on a form provided by the Board—of a sworn statement by the applicant that
10 the license has been neither revoked nor is currently suspended.
11 (d) Failure of a licensee to renew the license biennially and before expiration as
12 established under subsection (b), deprives the licensee of the right to practice until
13 reinstatement of the license. The license may be reinstated at any time during the first 24
14 months immediately following the date the license expired by payment of any penalty or
15 reinstatement fees established by the Board, in addition to the established renewal fee. Failure
16 of a licensee to be reinstated during the first 24 months immediately following the date the
17 license expired requires the individual, before resuming practice in the Virgin Islands, to submit
18 an application on the prescribed form, and to meet all other requirements for licensure. This
19 subsection may not be construed to permit a person to engage in the practice of social work in
20 the Virgin Islands without a valid and active license.
21 (e) The Board shall adopt a program of continuing education to ensure that all licensees
22 remain informed of those professional subjects that the Board considers appropriate to the
23 practice of social work. The Board may by regulation describe the methods by which the
24 requirements of the program must be satisfied. The licensee failure to meet the requirements
25 of continuing education results in nonrenewal of a license.
12
1 (f) A person licensed under this chapter who is not engaged in the practice of social
2 work or who does not live in the Virgin Islands may request, in writing, that the Board place
3 that person’s license in inactive status.
4 § 542. Fees
5 The Board shall establish and published fees. The Board shall file an annual report of its
6 activities with the Governor of the Virgin Islands and the report must include a statement of all
7 receipts and disbursements.
8 § 543. [Reserved for Future Use.]
9 § 544. [Reserved for Future Use.]
10 § 545. [Reserved for Future Use.]

11 (a) The Board may issue a license without examination to an applicant who has
12 satisfied to the Board that the applicant has passed an examination and is or has been licensed
13 or registered under the laws of another state, territory, or political subdivision of the United
14 States, whose standards, in the opinion of the Board, are the substantial equivalent of the
15 requirements of section 533, and whose license has not been suspended or revoked by the
16 licensing jurisdiction.
17 (b) An applicant for licensure under this section is only eligible for licensure at the
18 equivalent designation recognized in the jurisdiction in which the applicant for a license by
19 endorsement is currently licensed.
20 § 535. License requirement
21 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, it is unlawful for an individual to
22 engage, or otherwise attempt to engage, in the practice of social work unless licensed as a social
23 work associate, licensed social worker, licensed master social worker, or licensed clinical social
24 worker under the applicable provisions of this chapter. No persons licensed under this chapter
25 may engage in the practice of social work beyond the scope of their license.

6
1 (b) No person may purport to be a social worker or qualified to engage in the practice
2 of social work, by using the titles “social work associate”, “licensed social worker”, “licensed

4 “BSW”, “LSW”, “MSW”, “LMSW”, or “LCSW” or use any or symbols indicating or tending
5 to indicate that the person is a social worker, social work associate, licensed social worker,

13 worker”, “certified social worker” or “certified independent social worker” continues to be
14 valid for the duration of the license or until the Board issues an appropriate redesignated
15 license. A person licensed by the Board as a “social worker”, “certified social worker”, or
16 “certified independent social worker” may continue to use the prior designated licensure titles
17 for a period of two years or as otherwise provided by the Board. Except as specifically provided
18 otherwise, licensure titles are redesignated as follows:
19 (1) a “social worker” is redesignated as a “licensed social worker”;
20 (2) a “certified social worker” is redesignated as a “licensed master social
21 worker”; and
22 (3) a “licensed independent social worker” is redesignated as a “licensed clinical
23 social worker”.
24 (d) A person who, after a hearing, the Board finds to have unlawfully engaged, or
25 attempted to engage, in the practice of social work, or a person who knowingly assisted a person

3 penalties outlined in § 532(e), or other penalties permitted under this chapter, including §
4 539(b).
5 § 536. Exemption from requirement

16 work student”, “social work intern”, or any other title which clearly indicates the
17 student’s training status; or

9 or disability, the person’s personal representative, or other person authorized to sue on
10 his behalf;
11 (2) that a social work associate, licensed social worker, licensed master social
12 worker, or licensed clinical social worker is not required to treat as confidential a

13 (2) knowingly making a false statement in connection with or on an application;
14 or
15 (3) knowingly making a false statement on a form or in relation to a regulation
16 promulgated by the Board.
17 §539. Grounds for disciplinary proceedings
18 (a) The Board may deny an application or, after a hearing, refuse to renew, suspend,
19 revoke, censure, reprimand, restrict, or limit a license issued on proof that the person has
20 engaged in unprofessional conduct within the five years preceding the filing of the complaint
21 or the initiation of disciplinary action, including:
22 (1) conviction of a felony;
23 (2) conviction of a misdemeanor under this chapter;
24 (3) conviction of fraud or deceit in connection with the practice of social work
25 as defined in this chapter or in establishing qualifications under this chapter;

10
1 (4) aiding or abetting a person not licensed under this chapter who is falsely
2 representing themselves as a social worker licensed under this chapter;
3 (5) failing to be relicensed and continuing to represent themselves as licensed
4 after the expiration of their license;
5 (6) committing an act of gross negligence or condoning the act by an employee
6 or supervisee in the practice of social work;
7 (7) addiction to habit-forming drugs, which impairs the ability to perform their
8 work; or
9 (8) has knowingly violated a regulation of the Board.
10 (b) In addition to disciplinary powers provided in subsection (a), the Board may, after
11 a hearing, levy and collect administrative fines for violations of this chapter or a regulation of
12 the Board of not less than $100 but not more than $1,000, for each violation. Each violation
13 of this chapter or regulations of the Board pertaining to unlawfully engaging in the practice of
14 social work constitutes a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than $100, but not more
15 than $1,000.
16 § 540. Disciplinary proceedings
17 (a) The Board shall conduct all hearings, which must be recorded by stenograph.
18 Board decisions must be made by majority vote. The Board shall give not less than 20 days
19 advance notice of a hearing, which notice must be served personally or by registered mail.
20 (b) The respondent has the right to:
21 (1) representation, either by counselor otherwise;
22 (2) cross-examination of witnesses;
23 (3) to call witnesses on the respondent’s behalf; and
24 (4) to subpoena witnesses and documents.

11
1 (c) Judicial review of the refusal to allow an examination, to grant a license, or the
2 review of a disciplinary hearing must be in accordance with Virgin Islands statutes regulating
3 judicial review of administrative action.
4 § 541. Renewal of licenses
5 (a) All licenses are effective when issued by the Board.
6 (b) A license issued under this chapter is valid for two years from the date of
7 issuance and expires on the last day of the month of February.
8 (c) A license may be renewed by the payment of the renewal fee and by the completion
9 and submission—on a form provided by the Board—of a sworn statement by the applicant that
10 the license has been neither revoked nor is currently suspended.
11 (d) Failure of a licensee to renew the license biennially and before expiration as
12 established under subsection (b), deprives the licensee of the right to practice until
13 reinstatement of the license. The license may be reinstated at any time during the first 24
14 months immediately following the date the license expired by payment of any penalty or
15 reinstatement fees established by the Board, in addition to the established renewal fee. Failure
16 of a licensee to be reinstated during the first 24 months immediately following the date the
17 license expired requires the individual, before resuming practice in the Virgin Islands, to submit
18 an application on the prescribed form, and to meet all other requirements for licensure. This
19 subsection may not be construed to permit a person to engage in the practice of social work in
20 the Virgin Islands without a valid and active license.
21 (e) The Board shall adopt a program of continuing education to ensure that all licensees
22 remain informed of those professional subjects that the Board considers appropriate to the
23 practice of social work. The Board may by regulation describe the methods by which the
24 requirements of the program must be satisfied. The licensee failure to meet the requirements
25 of continuing education results in nonrenewal of a license.

12
1 (f) A person licensed under this chapter who is not engaged in the practice of social
2 work or who does not live in the Virgin Islands may request, in writing, that the Board place
3 that person’s license in inactive status.
4 § 542. Fees
5 The Board shall establish and published fees. The Board shall file an annual report of its
6 activities with the Governor of the Virgin Islands and the report must include a statement of all
7 receipts and disbursements.
8 § 543. [Reserved for Future Use.]
9 § 544. [Reserved for Future Use.]
10 § 545. [Reserved for Future Use.]
