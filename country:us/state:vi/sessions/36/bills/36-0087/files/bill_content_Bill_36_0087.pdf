PROPOSED BY: Senator Marise C. James
1 Be it enacted by the Legislature of the Virgin Islands:
2 SECTION 1. Title 7 Virgin Islands Code is amended by adding the following chapter
3 16:
4 “Chapter 16. Orchard Development
5 § 311. Legislative findings
6 The Legislature of the Virgin Islands finds that:
7 (a) The Virgin Islands imports approximately 97% of its food supply; making the
8 territory highly vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, high costs, and food insecurity;
9 (b) The 2021 Virgin Islands Agricultural Plan (“Plan”), developed pursuant to
10 Act No. 8404, emphasizes the need to improve local food production and food
11 sovereignty through sustainable and ecologically sound practices;
12 (c) Orchard development is specifically identified in the Plan as a High Priority
13 Project necessary for long-term agricultural sustainability and economic diversification
14 in the Virgin Islands;

2
1 (d) The establishment of local orchards supports climate resilience by promoting
2 perennial crops, soil conservation, and sustainable land use practices as outlined in the
3 Plan;
4 (e) The Plan highlights the importance of crop diversification, value-added
5 products, and agro-tourism, all of which can be directly supported by a strategically
6 developed orchard initiative;
7 (f) Orchard development contributes to job creation, supports small farm
8 businesses, and provides a pathway for generational farming; aligning with the Plan's
9 emphasis on education, training, and youth engagement in agriculture;
10 (g) Orchard development will provide educational, environmental, and economic
11 benefits by engaging youth and farming apprentices, improving tree cover, and offering
12 value-added crop opportunities for local processors and markets;
13 (h) The 2018 U.S. Virgin Islands Census of Agriculture showed significant
14 community interest in the production of local fruits such as mangoes, bananas, coconuts,
15 and breadfruit, reinforcing the need for an expanded orchard program;
16 (i) The Virgin Islands Department of Agriculture Master Land Listing reveals,
17 as of FY2025, that the vast majority of available and leased agricultural land is
18 concentrated on St. Croix, with no comparable availability of surveyed government-
19 owned agricultural land on St. Thomas or St. John;
20 (j) Creating an orchard on St. Croix aligns with the Plan's objective to improve
21 agricultural productivity and reduce the territory’s dependence on imported fruits, while
22 also enhancing access to fresh, nutritious, and locally grown food;
23 (k) Multiple parcels of Virgin Islands Corp land on St. Croix have already been
24 successfully leased for agricultural purposes including food crop and livestock

3
1 production; demonstrating existing infrastructure and administrative capacity to support
2 a new orchard project;
3 (l) The agricultural zoning, historical land use patterns, and availability of 30-
4 acre parcels on St. Croix, provide the most realistic and efficient opportunity to establish
5 an orchard initiative without displacing current operations or requiring costly land
6 acquisitions;
7 (m) The proposed orchard will cultivate a diverse array of culturally and
8 nutritionally significant fruit trees—including tamarind, mango, guava, soursop,
9 breadfruit, cashew apple, passion fruit, and more—thereby improving food security,
10 promoting local heritage, and supporting biodiversity.
